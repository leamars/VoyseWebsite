<h1 style="margin-top: 100px;">Terms of Use</h1>
    <p>Last updated: February 12th, 2014</p>
    
    <p>
    Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms") carefully. By downloading, accessing or using the 
    mobile applications, websites or other products or services (collectively, the "Services") of 
    Critical Ideas, Inc. and our affiliates ("Voyse", "we" or "us"), you agree to be bound by these 
    Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
    We may change or modify these Terms at any time and in our sole discretion. If we make 
    changes to these Terms, we will provide notice of such changes, such as by sending a 
    notification, posting a notice on the Services or updating the "Last Updated" date above. Your 
    continued use of the Services will confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms. We encourage 
    you to frequently review the Terms to ensure you understand the terms and conditions that apply 
    to your use of the Services. If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you must stop using the 
    Services and delete your Voyse account.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Have Fun</h2>
    <p>
    The language below is meant to support this rule. It allows us to continue providing and improving 
    our Services, and it helps to ensure that a few mean users don't ruin the fun for everyone else. 
    Your part in that is simple. Just use common senseâ€”keep sending awesome Voyses to your 
    friends, and please don't send Voyses that they don't want to receive.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Our Audience</h2>
    <h5>This section is about who can use Voyse.</h5>
    
    <p>
    Voyse is intended for use by people who are 13 years of age or older, and persons under 
    the age of 13 are prohibited from creating Voyse accounts. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    You affirm that you are either more than 18 years of age, or an emancipated minor, or possess 
    legal parental or guardian consent, and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, 
    conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in these Terms, 
    and to abide by and comply with these Terms. In addition, you affirm that you have not been 
    previously suspended or removed from the Services and do not have more than one Voyse 
    account.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    We may, in our sole discretion, refuse to offer the Services to any person or entity. We may, 
    without notice and in our sole discretion, terminate your right to use the Services, or any portion 
    of thereof, and block or prevent your future access to and use of the Services or any portion 
    thereof.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Usage Data</h2>
    <h5>This section is about data we collect.</h5>
    
    <p>
    By using the Voyse application you agree to let Voyse collect information about your usage 
    of the application, including interactions with Voyses. For example, when you open a message 
    we attempt to detect those interactions. You agree that we will 
    share the fact that you took these actions with the sender of the message. You also agree to let 
    Voyse collect certain types of information from and about your device. For example, if you 
    choose to use our "Find Friends" feature, you agree to let Voyse access the address book on 
    your device and upload data to its servers to sync your contacts and find which of your friends are 
    already Voyse users. For more information about the information we collect from you and your 
    device and Voyse's privacy practices, please review our <a href="http://voyse.me/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.

    </p>

    <p>
    You agree that you are solely responsible for your User Content and that Voyse is not 
    responsible or liable for any User Content. While we are not obligated to do so, we reserve the 
    right, and have absolute discretion, to review, screen and delete User Content at any time and for 
    any reason.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    You retain all ownership rights in your User Content. However, by submitting User Content 
    to Voyse, you hereby grant us a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable and 
    transferable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, create derivative works from, 
    distribute, perform and display such User Content in connection with the Services, subject to your 
    use of privacy settings in the Services to control who can see your User Content.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Feedback</h2>
    <h5>This section is about the feedback you may give us on our products and services.</h5>

We will be entitled to the unrestricted use and dissemination of such Feedback for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without acknowledgment or compensation to you. You waive any rights you may have to the Feedback (including any copyrights or moral rights). We like hearing from users, but please do not share your ideas with us if you expect to be paid or want to continue to own or claim rights in them.

    </p>
    
    <h2>Disputes</h2>
    
    <h4>1) Indemnification</h4>
    <p>
    By agreeing to these Terms you agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Critical Ideas, our 
    managing members, shareholders, employees, affiliates, licensors and suppliers (the "Voyse 
    Parties") from and against any and all complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, 
    liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys' fees) due to, arising out of, or relating in any way 
    to (a) your use of the Services; (b) any User Content you post, upload, use, distribute, store or 
    otherwise transmit through the Services; (c) your violation of these Terms; or (d) your violation of 
    the rights of another.
    </p>
    
    <h4>2) Limitation of Liability</h4>
    <p>
    Except where prohibited by law, in no event will Voyse or the Voyse Parties be liable for 
    any indirect, special, punitive, incidental, exemplary or consequential damages that result from 
    (a) the use of, or inability to use, the Services; (b) the provision of the Services or any materials

    advised of the possibility of such damages. You assume total responsibility for your use of the 
    Services. Your only remedy against Voyse for dissatisfaction with the Services or any content 
    is to stop using the Services. 
    </p>
    
    <h4>3) Arbitration</h4>

    <p>
    You and Voyse agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or your use of the

    party seeks equitable and other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, 
    trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING 
    IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL. You and Voyse agree (a) that any arbitration 
    will occur in Los Angeles County, California; (b) that arbitration will be conducted confidentially 
    by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; and (c) that the state or federal 
    courts of Los Angeles County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an 
    arbitration award and over any suit, if any, between the parties not subject to arbitration. Other 
    than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant 
    any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. WHETHER THE DISPUTE IS HEARD 
    IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, YOU AND Voyse WILL NOT COMMENCE AGAINST 
    THE OTHER A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR 
    PROCEEDING.
    </p>
    
    <h4>4) Forum and Venue</h4>
    <p>
    A lawsuit, if any, by you or Voyse against the other will occur in state or federal court in Los 
    Angeles County, California. You and Voyse agree that the jurisdiction and venue of these 
    courts is exclusive.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Applicable Law</h2>
    <p>
    Any dispute between you and Voyse will be governed by these Terms and the laws of the 
    State of California and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict of laws 
    principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Severability</h2>
    <p>
    If any provision of these Terms shall be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, 
    then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity 
    and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
    </p>
