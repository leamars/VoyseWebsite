        <p>Last Updated: February 12, 2014</p>
        <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by Critical Ideas, Inc. and our subsidiaries (collectively, "Voyse") when you use our websites, mobile applications and other online products and services (collectively, the "Services") or when you otherwise interact with us.
        </p>
        <p>
       We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our websites' homepages or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.
        </p>
        <h2>Collection of Information</h2>
        <h3 class="no-margin-top">Information You Provide to Us</h3>
        <p>
       We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you create an account, use the Services to send or receive a message (a “Voyse”), request customer support or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your username, password, email address, phone number, age and any other information you choose to provide.
        </p>
        <p>
   When you send or receive Voyses, we also temporarily collect, process and store the contents of the Voyses on our servers. The contents of Voyses are also temporarily stored on the devices of recipients. Once all recipients have listened to a Voyse, we automatically delete the Voyse from our servers and our Services are programmed to delete the Voyse from the recipients’ devices. However, users with access to a recording device can record the Voyse onto the separate recording device before it is deleted. We cannot guarantee that deletion always occurs within a particular timeframe. We also cannot prevent others from making copies of your Voyses (e.g., by using a separate recording device). If we are able to detect that the recipient has recorded a Voyse that you send, we will attempt to notify you. In addition, as for any other digital information, there may be ways to access Voyses while still in temporary storage on recipients’ devices or, forensically, even after they are deleted. You should not use Voyse to send Voyses if you want to be certain that the recipient cannot keep a copy.

        </p>
        <h3>Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Services</h3>
        <p>When you access or use our Services, we automatically collect information about you, including:</p>

        <ul>
              <li><b>Usage Information:</b> When you send or receive Voyses, we collect information about these Voyses, including the time, date, sender and recipient of the Voyse. We also collect information about the number of Voyses sent and received between you and your friends and which friends you exchange Voyses with most frequently.
</li>
              <li><b>Log Information:</b> We log information about your use of our websites, including your browser type and language, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the website you visited before navigating to our websites.</li>

        <h2>Analytics Services Provided by Others</h2>
        <p>
        We may allow others to provide analytics services on our behalf. These entities may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand your online activity.
        </p>
        <p>
        We work with Flurry to provide analytics in connection with the Voyse mobile application. For more information about Flurry's privacy practices, please visit <a href="http://www.flurry.com/privacy-policy.html">http://www.flurry.com/privacy-policy.html</a>. To opt-out of Flurry Analytics tracking used with the Voyse mobile application visit <a href="http://www.flurry.com/user-opt-out.html">http://www.flurry.com/user-opt-out.html</a>. Flurry is a separate company and cannot assist with Voyse-specific issues.
        </p>
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
        We take reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
        </p>
        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        <h3>Privacy Settings</h3>
    <p>
        You also have the ability to delete users from your friends list or to block specific users at any time by using controls within our Services.
        <p></p>
        <h3>Account Information</h3>
        <p>
        You may update or correct information about yourself by editing your account settings within our Services. If you wish to delete your account, please email us at <a href="mailto:team@Voyse.me">team@voyse.me</a>, but note that we may retain certain information as required by law, for legitimate business purposes, or as part of our regular retention practices. We may also retain cached or archived copies of information about you for a certain period of time.
        </p>
        <h3>Device Information</h3>
        <p>
        Certain features of the Services require access to your device's native phonebook and image storage applications (e.g., to find friends or to select a profile picture for your Voyse account from your photo gallery). If you choose to find friends, the names and phone numbers in your device's native phonebook will be transmitted to Critical Ideas. If you later decide to revoke your consent and prevent us from continuing to access your phonebook and image storage applications, you can do so by either changing the settings on your device, if this settings option is provided by your device operating system, or by following the standard uninstall process and removing our Services from your device. On iOS devices, you can grant or revoke your consent at any time and prevent us from continuing to access your phonebook and image storage applications by changing the settings on your device.
        </p>
        <h3>Location</h3>
        <p>
    When you first launch any features of our Services that collect location information, you will be asked to consent to our collection of this information. If you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information by changing the preferences on your mobile device. If you do so, certain features of our Services will no longer function. You may also stop our collection of location information by following the standard uninstall process to remove our Services from your device.
        </p>
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>
        Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our website.
        </p>
        <h3>Push Notifications/Alerts</h3>
        <p>
        Voyse may send push notifications or alerts to your device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your device (iOS) or by changing your settings within our Services (Android).
